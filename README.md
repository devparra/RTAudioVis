## Audio Spectrum Analysis & Visualization

This repository will provide tools for analyzing and visualizing the frequency content of audio signals, as well as extracting relevant features from them.

Spectrum Analysis: Implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) will be used to break down an audio signal into its constituent frequency components initially using Scipy. However, eventually the tool will be used for real-time analysis.

Visualization: Interactive visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib will enable users to explore the frequency content of audio signals in different formats, such as spectrograms and histograms.

Feature Extraction: The tool can be used to extract meaningful features from audio spectra.
